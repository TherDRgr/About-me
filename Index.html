    <h3>Hi there! I’m </h3>
    <h1>DIETHER RIGOR</h1>
    <p>a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for software development. 🚀</p>
    <p>As a career shifter, I’ve set my sights on becoming a Front-end developer. My programming journey began in October 2022, and although work sometimes pulled me away, I’m committed to refreshing my skills and pursuing my dream job.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I’m a seasoned freelancer specializing in Graphic Design. With 7 years of experience, I’ve honed my craft in Social Media Marketing services and Print advertising. 🎨</p>
    <p>When I’m not immersed in code or design, you’ll find me exploring scenic routes on my motorcycle, diving into FPS or Casual Games, and even building custom desktop computers. 🏍️🎮💻</p> 
       <p>Feel free to connect—I’m always up for a chat about tech, creativity, or the latest game releases! 🤝</p>
